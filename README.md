# US-LB-registry-arrests
This repo is going to hold the data and work related to an investigation into Chicago Police arrests of persons on a state registry, in particular, the sex offenders registry.

### hypothesis
We propose that a majority of the arrests of persons on the sex offenders registry happen in the arrested person's home, as opposed to a public location they are precluded from being in as per their parole agreement. 

### plan
- submit a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department ([sample](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/cpd-hate-crime-arrest-data-58789/)).
  - features to request:
    1. arrested person identifier
    2. arrested person age
    3. arrested person race
    4. arrested person sex
    5. arrested person gender identity
    6. all information about the arrested person's parole terms
    7. date of new arrest
    8. date of release from prison
    9. date of original arrest related to prison sentence served
    10. indicator of arrested persons employment status at the time of arrest
    11. all information about the arrested persons position or occupation at the time of arrest
    12. all information about the arrested persons
